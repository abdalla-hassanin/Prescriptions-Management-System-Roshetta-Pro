🚀 Exciting Project Announcement: RoshettaProAPI 🚀

I’m thrilled to share that I’ve completed a powerful Medical Prescription Management System named RoshettaProAPI!

💻 Built using ASP.NET Core Web API with Clean Architecture, this project is designed for efficiency, scalability, and security. Key features include:

✅ CQRS Design Pattern for clear command and query separation
✅ Generic Repository Pattern for a maintainable data layer
✅ JWT Authentication & Authorization (Roles & Claims)
✅ Email Service integration for user communication
✅ Fluent API Configurations & Fluent Validation for consistent data handling
✅ Swagger Documentation for seamless API exploration
✅ Pagination and Rate Limiting for optimized performance
✅ Identity Integration for secure user management
✅ JWT Token-Based Authentication
✅ Role-Based Access Control

🔐 The API ensures that doctors, patients, and medical administrators have role-specific access to patient data, prescriptions, and medical history, with support for X-ray uploads and reviews.
